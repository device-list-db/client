## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report any vulnerabilities discovered to the security tab on this project.

Updates on any given vulnerability will be sparse, as I am an independent developer working on this system. But expect a message back at least if it has been accepted or declined.

Expect any accepted vulnerabilities to be pushed up to the highest proprity I can give it, until it is fixed.
